This is remake of old client for http://www.diary.ru service. I wrote it for me and know about
security and logical problems. But it solve my problems and it is good.

## Uses:
- Python 2.7 (may be high, if you GUI)  
- wxWidgets as GUI
- requests or default urllib2

## Usage:

For Linux (with Unity you may have a problem with whitelist):  
    sudo pip install wxPython
    python2 diary.py

For Windows:  
Install two files of WxPython from [url](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#wxpython)  
Next execute start.bat
