py-DiaryRuInfo
==============

This is remake of old client for http://www.diary.ru service. I wrote it for me and know about security and logical problems. But it solve my problems and it is good.

## Uses:
- Python 3.4 (may be high, if you have GUI)  
- wxWidgets Phoenix as GUI
- requests or default urllib2

## Usage:

For Linux (with Unity you may have a problem with whitelist):  
    Load WxPython Phoenix from [url](http://wxpython.org/Phoenix/snapshot-builds/) and install it.
    python3 diary.py

For Windows:  
  Install pip from [url](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/)  
  Load WxPython Phoenix from [url](http://wxpython.org/Phoenix/snapshot-builds/)  
  Next (just for example):  
  pip install wxPython_Phoenix-3.0.2.dev77713-cp33-none-win32.whl

  Next execute start.bat
